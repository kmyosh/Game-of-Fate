## Iterations through eternity

### *the Fates predict the following updates:*

- Responsive display, it's not 600 B.C anymore. People should be able to check their fortune on any device.
- More detailed fortunes. Combinations that are more 'in-depth', so you can learn more about your future. (ie: more winning combos).
- Extra animations. While the Fates practice stoicism during readings, they would like the ability to 'react' to different outcomes.
